# HCDE 313 - Final Project

Webpage URL: https://musicfinalprojecthcde.appspot.com/

I used the MusicXMatch, Flickr and Spotify API to create a dynamic webpage. This webpage will allow users to input a song name and artist - to retreive information about the song's lyrics, pictures of the Artist, and the Artist's top songs.

As Google App Engine runs on Python 2, I wasn't able to deploy my sentiment analysis code. However, it can be seen in the file "sentiment_analysis.py"
